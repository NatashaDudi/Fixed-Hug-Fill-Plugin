# Fixed-Hug-Fill

_Fixed-Hug-Fill_ is a plugin for Figma to get an object with autolayout and change its align settings as well as the align settings from all its children to 'fixed', 'hug' or 'fill'.

TO DO:
- General testing
- Expand plugin so that it can be used with objects of type 'TEXT' and 'COMPONENT', ...
- Find out why it does not seem possible to change from 'fill' to 'hug'.
